Starting a game

Play 3ish rounds before you kick people out, if there are more people wanting to play.

Entering names
Enter each player's name. If there are fewer than 3 players you'll have to use "lose a turn" to skip empty spots

Playing

Spin
After the person spins, enter the $$ and hit the Spin button to make it official.

Guess a letter
Click a letter. It'll use whatever the spin is and score points (or move to the next person). If it seems like it isn't working, hit the spin button again.

Buy a vowel
Vowels cost 250. Hit the vowel button. Pick the vowel they want. Sometimes you have to hit the vowel button twice. Sorry.

Puzzles
If the puzzle has a word that doesn't fit on the first line, it'll wrap down to the second line.
e.g.
We love fortr
ess so much

Lose a turn / Bankrupt
If the player lands on one of these, hit the appropriate button. It will move to the next player.

Spin again
The contestant can take a Wheel of Fortin sticker from the board. After the game is done, put more stickers down.

Solve
Hit the solve button, that will give you the answer to the puzzle and Correct & Incorrect buttons. DON'T SAY THE ANSWER! If the person is correct, their score will go in the bank on the lower right. IF they are incorrect, they'll lose their turn.

New Puzzle
If no one is getting it or you don't like the puzzle or whatever, I'm not your boss. "New puzzle" will start a new round.

Quit
This will go back to entering new names. All previous scores and bank will be gone.
